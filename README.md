Hi, I’m Jamie! I am a Computer Science graduate from University of Washington, Seattle.<br>
I am currently involved in research focused on developing visualization tools for large-scale robotics datasets. 

In my free time, I make videogames, do cybersecurity CTF competitions, and contemplate philosophy.

My primary interest lies in tech privacy and security vulnerabilities, especially now as AI systems are rising in popularity and 
incorporated into modern technologies with little consideration to potential risks. 

Feel free to check out some of the projects I've done! :)
