Hi, I’m Jamie!<br>
I am a Computer Science graduate from University of Washington, Seattle.<br>
I do research focused on developing visualization tools for large-scale robotics datasets.<br>

In my free time, I enjoy making videogames, cybersecurity CTF competitions, and contemplating philosophy.

My primary interest lies in tech privacy and security vulnerabilities, especially nowadays as AI systems are rising in popularity 
and incorporated into modern technologies with little consideration to potential risks.

Feel free to check out some of the projects I've done! :)
