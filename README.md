Hi, Iâ€™m Jamie! I am a senior studying Computer Science at UW, Seattle. I like programming with various languages including Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript and more. Right now I'm part of a research project focused on developing advanced tools for visualizing large-scale datasets in robotics. I work with ML frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow and design clustering algorithms with my team. <br>
In my free time, I participate in CTF competitions as a part of UW's Cybersecurity club (Batman's Kitchen).<br>
I believe that being aware of privacy and security vulnerabilities has never been more important, especially nowadays. There has been an influx of new systems that incorporate AI and ML technologies with little consideration to the risks that come with using them. And that scares me. <br>

I'm passionate about what I do, and I'm always seeking more opportunities to understand more about AI, the ethics of computing and how to secure systems & programs from external threats.<br>

Ask me about some cool projects I've worked on!<br>
